Hello visitor!<br/>
This is a simple contact manager program made by me. It is eniterly made in **java** and uses **MySql** as the database.<br/>
In order to connect with the database, I have used **JDBC**, i.e. Java Database Connectivity. It allows me to connect to the database and run queries to perform CRUD operations on the database.<br/>
The application is console based, so it uses switch case based UI.<br/>
The future scope for this application would be creating a front end which would make the user experience even better.
